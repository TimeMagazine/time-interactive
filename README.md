v0.7.2

# Introduction

Our interactives at Time are developed independently from the CMS and bundled into self-assembling Javascript files using [`bundle-module`](https://github.com/wilson428/bundle-module), and external [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) bundler maintained by [Chris Wilson](@wilson428). They are both discrete--requiring no dependencies--and discreet--interfering as little as possible with the rest of the page. 

You can also see the [wiki](https://github.com/TimeMagazine/time-interactive/wiki) for instructions on installation and usage. 

## Getting started

	npm install -g time-interactive

This repository provides both a [command-line script](https://github.com/TimeMagazine/time-interactive/blob/master/bin/generate.js) for generating new projects and a [client-side script](https://github.com/TimeMagazine/time-interactive/blob/master/index.js) with a few convenience functions.

## Generating a project

When globally installed, the module with bootstrap a project with the id you provide.

	time-interactive [project_id]

If the script detects an existing `time-interactive` project by that name with an older version, it will ask you if you want to update.

## Compiling

To bundle your project, you **must** have `bundle-module` globally installed:

	npm install bundle-module -g

You can compile your interactive with either `npm run build` (development), which is loaded by `index.html`, or `npm run minify`, which is loaded by `embed.html`. You can also build the development version on every file change with `npm run watch`.

### Building

Since v0.6.2, every project generated by the module had two Webpack configurations and a long list of development dependencies for local bundling. This meant every project had a busy `node_modules` directory and was frozen at the state of Webpack at the time it was generated, which is good and bad.

Seeing as all the Webpack configs and dependencies were redundant, I created a global Webpack bundler, [bundle-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-module), that is always reasonably up-to-date and contains all the loaders you're likely to need, such as HTML/EJS templates, SASS/LESS, `.\*sv`, etc. At some future point, I may work in the option of a local webpack config, which is generally generated dynamically. In the meantime, if you need a loader that isn't present, please raise and issue or PR on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wilson428/bundle-module) or, if you must, just [e-mail me](mailto:wilson@mechanicalscribe.com) to complain :)

In cases were an old, "broken" module requires globals--here's looking at you, jQuery--the configuration file may need to be [shimmed](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) to execute correctly. This also may be required if [using underscore templates](https://github.com/difelice/ejs-loader#usage).

#### Loaders

The following types of files may be imported in `debug.js`:

+ *Text*: using [raw-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader)
+ *.css*: using [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader). This currently _does_ resolve paths in `url()` calls. It allows uses the [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#webpack) plugin to ensure browser compatibility.
+ *.less* and *.scss*: You can import `.less` and `.scss` files as well using [less-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/less-loader) and [sass-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader). These are also autoprefixed.
+ *.html* and *.ejs*: The [ejs-loader](https://github.com/difelice/ejs-loader) handles both `.ejs` templates and raw `.html`.
+ *.csv*, *.tsv*, *.dsv*: The [dsv-loader](https://github.com/wbkd/dsv-loader) can handle any delimited file.
+ *.png*, *.jpg*, *.jpg*, *.gif*: The [file-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader) plug can import images.
